**Definition:** ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. 

It defines the structure and organization of these files so that the operating system can load, link, and execute them.
  
An ELF file consists primarily of the following: 
1. [[ELF Header]] 
2. [[Program Headers (Load Segments)]] 
3. [[Section Headers]]
