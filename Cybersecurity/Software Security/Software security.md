Software security encompasses the principles, practices, and techniques employed to design, develop, and maintain software systems that operate as intended, even when subjected to malicious attacks or unexpected conditions. It aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of software and the data it processes. This involves identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities – weaknesses in the software that could be exploited by attackers – through proactive measures like secure coding practices, rigorous testing, and ongoing security monitoring. Ultimately, the goal of software security is to build resilient and trustworthy software that can withstand threats and safeguard valuable assets.

In the context of Software Security the main focus is on the [[ELF]] files as a standard.

The transformation of a human-readable C source file into an executable ELF file is a multi-stage process involving several key tools and transformations. Understanding this process is fundamental to software security and reverse engineering.
The steps incluse:
	1.[[Preprocessing]].
	2.[[Compilation]].
	3.[[Linking]].

Usually in this context a [[Debugger]] is adopted for reverse engineering, malware analysis and others.
