* An array of structures. Each structure describes a *section* of the ELF file. 
* Sections are smaller, more granular units than segments. 
* Sections contain different types of data, such as code, data, symbol tables, and debugging information. 
* Key Information within each header: 
	* `sh_name`: Section name (index into the string table). 
	* `sh_type`: Section type (e.g., code, data, symbol table). 
	* `sh_flags`: Section flags (e.g., writable, executable). 
	* `sh_addr`: Virtual address of the section in memory (if loaded). 
	* `sh_offset`: Offset of the section in the file. 
	* `sh_size`: Size of the section in bytes. 
	* `sh_link`: Section index of related section. 
	* `sh_info`: Extra information, dependent on section type. 
	* `sh_addralign`: Address alignment constraints. 
	* `sh_entsize`: Size of each entry, if section contains an array of fixed-size entries. 

Used primarily by linkers, loaders, and debuggers. Sections are not *strictly* necessary for program execution if Program Headers exist but are crucial for linking and debugging.
