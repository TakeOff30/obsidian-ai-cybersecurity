A **web spider**, also known as a **web crawler** or **bot**, is an automated program that systematically browses the internet to collect and index information from web pages. Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo use web spiders to discover and update content on websites.

### **How Web Spiders Work**

1. **Start with a List of URLs** – A web spider begins with a predefined set of URLs (seed URLs).
2. **Fetch the Web Pages** – It downloads the HTML content of these pages.
3. **Extract Links** – The spider identifies hyperlinks within the page and adds new URLs to its queue.
4. **Repeat the Process** – The crawler continues visiting newly discovered links, following predefined rules (e.g., staying within a domain).
5. **Indexing** – The collected data is analyzed and stored in a search engine database for later retrieval.
