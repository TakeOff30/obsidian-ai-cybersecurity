Important because delineates what can or cannot be done on a system

practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks

practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices from malicious attacks

technologies, practices and policies for preventing cuberattacks or mitigating their impact

integrity, confidentiality, computer security, access control, availability

confidentiality, historical cipher, modern cipher

integrity, hash, message authentication code, digital signature

computer security, buffer overflow, side-channel leakage, transient execution

access control, password, authentication, access control, network security, web security

confidentiality
only authorized parties can access non public information

integrity
data remain unalterated except by authorized parties
error detection/correction code
cryptographic checksums

authentication


authorization
resources are accessible by authorized entities

accountability
ability to identify entities responsible for past actions, to trace who did what in the past

availability
resources are readily accessible for authorized parties
redudant systems prevent from ddos attacks

non-repudiation: unable to refute responsibility

forgeability: ability to create valid messages / signatures

forward secrecy: retaining security over previous transactions

future secrecy: self-healing after compromise
