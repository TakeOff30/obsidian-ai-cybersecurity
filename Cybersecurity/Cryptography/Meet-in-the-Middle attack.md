## Overview

The **Meet-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack** is a cryptographic attack technique used against encryption schemes that use multiple encryption steps, such as **double encryption** or **hash chaining**. It significantly reduces the time complexity of brute-force attacks by precomputing and storing intermediate values.
## How It Works

1. **Applicable Scenarios:**
    - Used against encryption systems that apply multiple rounds of encryption, such as **Double DES**.
    - Works when there is a middle step that can be calculated from both directions (encryption and decryption).
        
2. **General Attack Process:**
    - Suppose a system uses **two keys** and , and encryption follows the formula:
        where is the plaintext and is the ciphertext.
    - The attacker aims to find and using a known plaintext-ciphertext pair.
        
3. **Steps of the Attack:**
    - **Step 1: Compute Forward Encryptions**
        - The attacker **encrypts** the plaintext using all possible values of , generating intermediate values:
        - Store these intermediate values in a table indexed by .
            
    - **Step 2: Compute Backward Decryptions**
        - The attacker **decrypts** the ciphertext using all possible values of , generating:
        - Look up each in the precomputed table from Step 1.
            
    - **Step 3: Identify Matching Pairs**
        - When a match is found, the corresponding keys are candidates for the correct encryption keys.
            
## Complexity Reduction

- A naive brute-force attack on **Double DES** requires operations (since each DES key is 56 bits).
- MITM reduces this to encryptions and decryptions, requiring only space.
- This makes double encryption **no stronger** than single encryption against a MITM attack.
    
## Defenses Against MITM

- **Use More Rounds:** Triple DES (3DES) uses three keys, which prevents a simple MITM attack.
- **Key Whitening:** Mixing additional randomness into encryption steps increases security.
- **Use Nonlinear Key Mixing:** Ensuring that intermediate values do not follow predictable patterns.

### Attack Execution

1. Encrypt with all possible values and store results.
2. Decrypt with all possible values and check for matches in the stored results.
3. Once a match is found, test on additional data to confirm correctness.
    

## Summary

- **MITM attacks exploit multi-step encryption systems by precomputing and storing intermediate values.**
- **They dramatically reduce the effective key search space, making naive double encryption insecure.**
- **Triple encryption and nonlinear key transformations help mitigate MITM attacks.**
