"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers 'wrap around' upon reaching a certain value, called the modulus. It's a foundational concept for many cryptographic algorithms, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve cryptography."
        
Core Idea: "Instead of working with integers directly, we work with their remainders after division by a fixed integer (the modulus)."
        
Congruence: "The central concept is **congruence**. Two integers are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when divided by n."
        
Provides the mathematical framework for performing secure calculations with integers. The finite nature of modular arithmetic allows for efficient computation, while the difficulty of certain problems within this system (e.g., discrete logarithm problem) underpins the security of many cryptographic algorithms.
    
Operations: "Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation can all be performed within modular arithmetic. Division is more complex and requires the concept of a multiplicative inverse."
