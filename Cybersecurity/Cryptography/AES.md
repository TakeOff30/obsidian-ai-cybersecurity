AES is a symmetric cipher, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It's also a block cipher, meaning it operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits in the case of AES).
    
**Key Sizes:** AES supports three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits. The key size affects the number of rounds (iterations) of the encryption process. Longer keys provide stronger security.
    
**Rounds:** The encryption and decryption processes involve multiple "rounds." The number of rounds depends on the key size:    
    - 128-bit key: 10 rounds
    - 192-bit key: 12 rounds
    - 256-bit key: 14 rounds
