Definition: "The equivalence class of an integer a modulo n, denoted [a]n, is the set of all integers that are congruent to a modulo n. In other words, [a]n = {x ∈ Z | x ≡ a (mod n)}."
        
Complete Residue System: "A complete residue system modulo n is a set of n integers such that every integer is congruent to exactly one element of the set modulo n. The set {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1} is a common complete residue system."
        
Equivalence classes provide a way to partition the set of integers into distinct, non-overlapping sets. Operations performed on equivalence classes are well-defined, which is critical for cryptographic systems.
