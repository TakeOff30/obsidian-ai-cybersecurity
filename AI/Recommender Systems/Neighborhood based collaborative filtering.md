Aims to find the most similar users or items to a target element. Based on the similarity the items or users are filtered to generate recommendations. 

This method is further classified as neighborhood-based because the goal is to find the most similar entities in a given space.

The core assumption of collaborative filtering is that similar users exhibit similar rating patterns and similar items receive similar ratings.

Types of Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering:
- [[User-based collaborative filtering]]
- [[Item-based collaborative filtering]]

All Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering algorithms rely on a **[[Rating matrix]]**.
