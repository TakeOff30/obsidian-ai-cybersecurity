The process of constructing the similarities is dual to the user-based models, we just need to transpose the [[Rating matrix]].
It is more useful when the number of items is larger than users.
Items have characteristics that are well defined while user data in sparse so item-based models provide a more stable and scalable approach.
The item similarity calculation often involves using cosine similarity and item vectors are created based on user vectors.
