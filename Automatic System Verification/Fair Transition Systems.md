In automatic sytem verification FTS are a model used to represent systems where fairness constraints are crucial to ensure realistic and correct behavior. These systems are an extension of standard transition systems, incorporating [[Justice (weak fairness)]] and [[Compassion (strong fairness)]] to rule out unrealistic executions. Below, I provide precise definitions of all the key concepts, including [[Computation]], [[Run]], and how fairness constraints operate.
