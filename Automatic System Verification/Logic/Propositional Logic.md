[[Logic]] based formalism of Boolean variables $\sum={p,q,r,...}$ and Boolean connectives which are combined as
	$p|q|...|\varphi\vee\varphi|\varphi\wedge\varphi|\neg\varphi|\varphi\rightarrow\varphi|\varphi\leftrightarrow\varphi$ 
To understand whether a formula is true or false we need to assign values (true/false) to the variables.
**_QUANTIFIED BOOLEAN FORMULAS_**: it is an extension of propositional logic that adds quantifiers $\exists,\forall$.
