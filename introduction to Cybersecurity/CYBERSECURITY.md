**CYBER** means :
- involving, using, or relating to computers, especially the internet
- of relating to, or involving computers or computer networks (such as the Internet)
### MOTIVATION
if two user use a public channel to communicate important information a third part (eve) can intercept the message, read it and eventually modify it. We want to avoid these situations, thus ensure [[CONFIDENTIALITY]], and ensure the [[INTEGRITY]] of the messages sends across the public channel and the availability of it.

* [[INTEGRITY]], guarantees that data remains unalterated except by authorized parties. achieved via:
	* error detection/correction
	* crypthographic checksums
* AVAILABILITY, ensures that resources are readily accessible for authorized parties.
* [[CONFIDENTIALITY]], ensuring that only authorized parties can access non-public information. implemented through:
	* data encryption
	* access control mechanism

# Security Goal:
different security goals are achieved through different approaches like:
1. **AUTHENTICATION**: Verifying the identity of an entity if it is genuine 
	*Example*: 
	- Entity authentication 
	- Data origin authentication
2. **AUTHORIZATION**: Resources are accessible only by authorized entities 
	*Example*: 
	* Access control 
	* Access restriction
3. **ACCOUNTABILITY**: Ability to identify entities responsible for past actions 
	*Example*: 
	* Audit log
4. **AVAILABILITY**: Resources are readily accessible for authorized parties 
	*Example*:
	* Redundant system
5. **NON-REPUDIATION :** unable to refute responsibility 
6. **FORGEABILITY** : ability to create valid messages / signatures 
7. **FORWARD SECRECY** : retaining security of previous 
8. transactions 
9. **FUTURE SECRECY** : self-healing after compromise

# Cryptographic Primitives
*Cryptography is a fundamental building block for cybersecurity*

1. ***Encryption / decryption*** : AES, RSA, ECC, . . .
2. ***Key exchange / agreemen***t : Diffieâ€“Hellman, . . . 
3. ***Message authentication code*** : HMAC, Poly1305, . . . 
4. ***Digital signature*** : Schnorr, ECDSA, . . .
5. ***Cryptographic hash function*** : SHA, Keccak, . . .
